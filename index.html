    <p>I’m Luis Velasquez — a digital product leader with a background in engineering, a passion for clean design, and a track record of delivering real-world impact. I specialize in building tools that simplify complexity, whether it's geospatial platforms for infrastructure planning, AI-powered workflows for insurance and compliance, or systems that connect strategy to user needs.</p>

    <p>Currently, I lead the Smart Atlas Viewer, helping global teams turn data into decisions. I’m also an endurance athlete, real estate investor, and nonprofit founder — because solving problems and pushing limits is just part of who I am.</p>

    <p>Let’s build something that works — and lasts.</p>

    <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

    <p>I'm excited to apply for the Product Owner position at StreetLight Data. With a background in transportation engineering, cross-sector collaboration, and user-centered digital solutions, I’m eager to bring my experience delivering geospatial tools and analytics platforms to an organization shaping the future of mobility.</p>

    <p>In my current role as Product Owner for Smart Atlas, I’ve led the development of a browser-based geospatial viewer used by 1000+ staff across 18 countries. This solution improves access to spatial data without requiring advanced GIS tools, reducing project delivery timelines by up to 50%. I’ve translated user feedback into actionable product strategies, working closely with technical teams to deliver high-value mapping features—from drawing tools and print/export to 3D terrain and data layer integration.</p>

    <p>Prior to this, I worked extensively with public sector transportation clients, including the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), where I helped deliver statewide data programs, environmental modeling tools, and operational planning initiatives. Through these roles, I developed a deep appreciation for how data quality, workflows, and end-user needs shape real-world transportation decisions.</p>

    <p>What excites me about StreetLight is your mission to turn complex mobility patterns into usable insights—and your focus on big data, mapping, and infrastructure impact. I’m especially drawn to the opportunity to serve as a bridge between stakeholders and technical teams, aligning sprints and backlogs with product vision and customer value. I bring strengths in Agile facilitation, GIS use-case evaluation, and cross-functional collaboration, along with a naturally curious and systems-oriented mindset.</p>

    <p>I’d be honored to contribute to your team’s efforts to scale high-quality transportation data products that make cities and infrastructure more adaptive, efficient, and equitable. Thank you for considering my application—I’d welcome the opportunity to speak further.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,<br />Luis Velasquez</p>
