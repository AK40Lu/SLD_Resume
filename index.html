        <p>I’m Luis Velasquez — a digital product leader with an engineering background and a passion for building tools that make complex work feel simple. From geospatial platforms to internal automation frameworks, I focus on creating solutions that are clear, scalable, and genuinely useful to the people who rely on them.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I love building apps to explore new ideas (and teach my kids along the way), woodworking in the garage, and getting outside whenever I can. I’m a dad, a husband, and the guy who enjoys spending time at the whiteboard or the mountain bike trails — or both. We’ve got a couple of pets, a busy household, and a lot of projects in motion — which is just how we like it.</p>
        <p>I’m looking for the next opportunity to bring thoughtful products to life — where I can collaborate with smart teams, solve meaningful problems, and grow as both a builder and a leader. I’m especially energized by roles that blend strategy, creativity, and user focus, whether that’s in infrastructure, tech, or something entirely new.

If you’re curious about how I think and work, take a look at my cover letter and resume — and feel free to reach out. I’d love to connect.</p>

        <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>
        <p>I'm excited to apply for the Product Owner position at StreetLight Data. With a background in transportation engineering, cross-sector collaboration, and user-centered digital solutions, I’m eager to bring my experience delivering geospatial tools and analytics platforms to an organization shaping the future of mobility.</p>
        <p>In my current role as Product Owner for Smart Atlas, I’ve led the development of a browser-based geospatial viewer used by 1000+ staff across 18 countries. This solution improves access to spatial data without requiring advanced GIS tools, reducing project delivery timelines by up to 50%. I’ve translated user feedback into actionable product strategies, working closely with technical teams to deliver high-value mapping features—from drawing tools and print/export to 3D terrain and data layer integration.</p>
        <p>Prior to this, I worked extensively with public sector transportation clients, including the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), where I helped deliver statewide data programs, environmental modeling tools, and operational planning initiatives. Through these roles, I developed a deep appreciation for how data quality, workflows, and end-user needs shape real-world transportation decisions.</p>
        <p>What excites me about StreetLight is your mission to turn complex mobility patterns into usable insights—and your focus on big data, mapping, and infrastructure impact. I’m especially drawn to the opportunity to serve as a bridge between stakeholders and technical teams, aligning sprints and backlogs with product vision and customer value. I bring strengths in Agile facilitation, GIS use-case evaluation, and cross-functional collaboration, along with a naturally curious and systems-oriented mindset.</p>
        <p>I’d be honored to contribute to your team’s efforts to scale high-quality transportation data products that make cities and infrastructure more adaptive, efficient, and equitable. Thank you for considering my application—I’d welcome the opportunity to speak further.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,<br>Luis Velasquez</p>
